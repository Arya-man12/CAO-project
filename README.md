# CAO-project
This project is a library management system that makes use of two types of parallel processing,using shared memory(cython) or distributed memory(python multiprocesing module).Cython makes code faster to execute and enables parallel processing using threads.But cython is unable to bypass pythons Global interpreter lock,except in a few circumstances.An alternative to this is pythons multiprocessing module which allows multiprocessing,but it works in a different manner than cython.It creates  small slices of pythons interpreter for each process to execute,in effect creating thousands of small copies of the same program.While this approach is good it is obviously more hardware intensive.Hence,we have decided to combine the best of the two approaches.We have used cython to set the number of users using the num_threads variable which checks the number of users in the mysql users database and we have parallelised some of the processes using multiprocessing module so that multiple users can access them at same time.This way we only create new processes when new users come and reduce processes when users leave.
We have also used omp_set_dynamic to variably adjust the number of threads available for execution.We have not parallelised the borrowing and returning function of the program as this may cause issues when multiple users are trying to access the same book in the database at the same time.
